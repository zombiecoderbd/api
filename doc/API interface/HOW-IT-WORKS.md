## What Happens Behind the Scenes

### When You Type a Message

```
1. You type: "এই কোডটি রিভিউ করো"
2. Server receives your message
3. Server decides which agents to ask
4. Agents read your project files (SSOT)
5. Agents check their knowledge (Syllabus)
6. Agents remember past conversations (Memory)
7. Agents discuss among themselves
8. Agents give you the best answer
```

### The Agent Selection Process

```
Simple question → 1-2 agents (quick answer)
Code review → Code Guru + QA Tyrant
Security issue → Security Hero
Bug fix → Bug Hunter
Complex task → All 6 agents (full debate)
```

## What the Agents Know

### Your Project (SSOT)

The agents automatically learn about your project:
- What files you have
- What language you use
- What framework you're using
- What dependencies you have

This happens when you first connect. No manual setup needed.

### Your History (Memory)

The agents remember:
- What you talked about before
- What problems you had
- What solutions worked

This helps them give better answers over time.

### What They've Learned (Syllabus)

The agents keep track of:
- Common issues in your project
- Your coding patterns
- Best practices for your stack
- Things that worked before

## How Agents Talk to Each Other

### Direct Response

For simple questions, one agent answers directly.

### Collaboration

For complex tasks, agents work together:

```
You: "এই কোডটি রিভিউ করো"

Code Guru: "Let me check the code..."
Code Guru: "Security Hero, check for vulnerabilities"
Security Hero: "Found SQL injection at line 45"
Code Guru: "Performance Wizard, optimize this"
Performance Wizard: "Add index to database query"
Code Guru: [Combines all feedback and responds to you]
```

## What Tools Agents Can Use

Agents can:
- **Read your files** — To understand your code
- **Write files** — To create or modify code
- **Search the web** — To find current information
- **List directories** — To see project structure
- **Open browsers** — To test web pages

## Common Questions

### "Will it work with my VS Code?"

Yes! Mission Barisal works with VS Code through MCP.
Just configure the MCP settings and it connects automatically.

### "Does it work with Bengali?"

Yes! The agents respond in Bengali and preserve all Bengali characters.
Even complex conjunct characters work correctly.

### "What if it doesn't know something?"

The agent will honestly say "I don't know" and suggest alternatives.
It never makes up information.

### "Is my code safe?"

Yes! The agents only read your files when you ask them to.
They don't send your code anywhere without permission.

### "Can I use it offline?"

The server runs locally on your machine.
Your code never leaves your computer.

## How to Build Your Own Chat App

### Simple Version

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
  <input type="text" id="input" placeholder="Type here">
  <button onclick="send()">Send</button>
  <div id="response"></div>

  <script>
    async function send() {
      const input = document.getElementById('input').value;
      const response = await fetch('http://localhost:5000/v1/chat/completions', {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
        body: JSON.stringify({
          model: 'mission',
          messages: [{ role: 'user', content: input }]
        })
      });
      const data = await response.json();
      document.getElementById('response').textContent = 
        data.choices[0].message.content;
    }
  </script>
</body>
</html>
```

### With Streaming

```javascript
async function streamChat(message) {
  const response = await fetch('http://localhost:5000/v1/chat/completions', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      model: 'mission',
      messages: [{ role: 'user', content: message }],
      stream: true
    })
  });

  const reader = response.body.getReader();
  while (true) {
    const { done, value } = await reader.read();
    if (done) break;
    // Process streaming chunks
  }
}
```
