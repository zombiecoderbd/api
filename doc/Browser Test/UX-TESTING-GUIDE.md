# User Experience Testing Guide

## How to Test Like a Real User, Not a Developer

This document explains how to test the system from a user's perspective,
not just feature testing. Focus on real-world experience.

## Why UX Testing Matters

### Feature Testing vs UX Testing

| Feature Testing | UX Testing |
|----------------|------------|
| Does the button work? | Is the button easy to find? |
| Does the API return data? | Is the response helpful? |
| Does the code run? | Is the code maintainable? |
| Does the error show? | Is the error message clear? |

### What Users Care About

1. **Speed** — Does it respond quickly?
2. **Clarity** — Is the answer easy to understand?
3. **Helpfulness** — Does it solve my problem?
4. **Honesty** — Does it admit when it doesn't know?
5. **Language** — Does it respond in my language?
6. **Context** — Does it understand my project?

## Performance Testing

### Response Time

| Action | Expected | Maximum |
|--------|----------|---------|
| Health check | < 100ms | 500ms |
| Simple greeting | < 2s | 5s |
| Code review | < 10s | 30s |
| Full mission | < 30s | 60s |
| Streaming start | < 1s | 2s |

### How to Measure

```javascript
// In browser console
console.time('response');
fetch('http://localhost:5000/v1/chat/completions', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    model: 'mission',
    messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Hello' }]
  })
})
.then(r => r.json())
.then(data => {
  console.timeEnd('response');
  console.log('Response:', data.choices[0].message.content);
});
```

### Memory Usage

| Component | Expected | Maximum |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| Server | < 100MB | 500MB |
| Client | < 50MB | 200MB |
| Per session | < 1MB | 10MB |

console.log(performance.getEntriesByName('response')[0].duration);
```

### Network Tab

1. Open DevTools → Network
2. Filter by XHR/Fetch
3. Check response times
4. Verify request/response format

### Console Logging

```javascript
